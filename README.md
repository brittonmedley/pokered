## Rules
Origial nuzlocke rules came from [here][nuzlockerules].

Summary of rules:
* When a pokemon faints, it is dead unless the player has a revive. A fainted pokemon is gone forever.
* All potions and healing items (burn heal, prlyz heal, frz heal, etc. including revives) have been removed from all Pokemarts (are still in map items and hidden locations). 
* Only the first pokemon in each area can be caught (takes effect after delivering the parcel to OAK). The only exception is if you have already caught that type of pokemon.
* Blackout (wihtout revive(s)) means the game is over, and the save file is deleted.
* Every pokemon must be nicknamed.
